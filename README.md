# AzureFW-GitOps

This project intends to provide a GitOps experience for Azure Firewall in order to make Azure Firewall IaC easier and improve the overall user experience of authoring/configuring Azure Firewall Policies and rules.
In short AzureFW GitOps creates a new way of configuring Azure Firewall Policies and allows for a two-way sync of rules and configuration allowing Azure FW GitOps & ClickOps Azure FW policy authoring. You can choose yourself if you want to have the repository as single source of truth or if both Repo & Azure Portal authoring is allowed.

# Module installation
```Install-Module -Name AzureFwGitOps	```

# How it works

This project utilizes [AzOps](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps) as the IaC backend and aims to mirror the structure that AzOps creates and uses.
There is a demo project in Azure DevOps which puts all these things into action and provides a real-world example on how everything can be put together.
- [Pipelines (External Azure DevOps)](https://dev.azure.com/freakling/AzureAutomation/_build?view=folders)
- [Repository (External Azure DevOps)](https://dev.azure.com/freakling/AzureAutomation/_git/AzOps-Accelerator)

At the heart of this project is a powershell module which translates between ``Azure ARM templates`` and ``Azure FW GitOps`` as well as a [pipeline](.pipelines\examples\.templates\azureFwGitOps.yml) to track and implement changes.

- [AzureFwGitOps.psm1](/AzureFwGitOps/AzureFwGitOps.psm1)

To properly use this module it is recommended to integrate it into your ci/cd pipelines. There are some examples in this repository, but feel free to change and integrate and submit a PR to this repo with more examples

- [Github Actions](.github/workflows)

## Azure ARM templates -> Azure FW GitOps

```
ConvertFrom-ArmFw -ArmFolder $ArmFolder -PolicyFolder $PolicyFolder -Merge
```
The above command reads ARM templates for ``Microsoft.Network/firewallPolicies`` and ``Microsoft.Network/firewallPolicies/ruleCollectionGroups`` resources and generates a easy to read ``policySettings.json`` and csv files that are easy to edit for ApplicationRules, NatRules and NetworkRules.

``$ArmFolder`` is the AzOps resource group folder where Firewall resides.

``$PolicyFolder`` is the folder where you intend to place the GitOps content.

The switch parameter ``-Merge`` specifies that updates from ARM is merged with any rules written in rule files. This is only recommended if hybrid authoring mode is preferred. For immutable mode is preferred ``-Merge`` should be avoided. 

## Azure FW GitOps -> Azure ARM templates
```
ConvertTo-ArmFw -ArmFolder $ArmFolder -PolicyFolder $PolicyFolder
```
The above command reads settings from ``PolicyFolder`` and writes to AzOps resource group specified by ``$ArmFolder``. The function is not capbable of creating files on its own nor does it associate policies with firewalls or other policies. See Todo for more information
# Setup More information
## AzOps file structure
```
ðŸ“‚<resourceGroupFolder>
 â”£ ðŸ“œmicrosoft.network_firewallpolicies-<policyName>.json
 â”£ ðŸ“œmicrosoft.network_firewallpolicies_rulecollectiongroups-<policyName>_<ruleCollGroupName>.json
 â”£ ...
 â”— ...
```

## Firewall GitOps file structure
```
ðŸ“¦policies
 â”£ ðŸ“‚<policyName>
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚<ruleCollGroupName>
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚<ruleCollName>
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œApplicationRule.csv
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚<ruleCollName>
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œNetworkRule.csv
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚<ruleCollName>
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œNatRule.csv
 â”£ ðŸ“‚<policyName>
 â”ƒ â”—...
 â”— ðŸ“œpolicySettings.json
```
## Rule files and configuration
Headers follow ``FirewallPolicyRule`` objects, [more info in the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.network/firewallpolicies/rulecollectiongroups?pivots=deployment-language-arm-template#firewallpolicyrule-objects-1).
 At the time of writing AzOps performs a pull using apiVersion "2020-11-01". If the apiVersion adds a type it will automatically get included, albeit unsorted.

### Examples
[policySettings.json](/policies/policySettings.json)

[ApplicationRule.csv](/policies/fwpolicy/rulecollgroup/app-rulecoll/ApplicationRule.csv)

[NetworkRule.csv](/policies/fwpolicy/rulecollgroup/net-rulecoll/NetworkRule.csv)

[NatRule.csv](/policies/fwpolicy/rulecollgroup/net-rulecoll/NatRule.csv)



### policySettings
``policySettings.json`` provides the more static configuration where Policy configuration can be stored, example of configuration defined here is child-policies, RuleCollectionGroup priority settings etc.
It is recommended to generate this file using the ``ConvertFrom-ArmFw`` function once the initial structure is created in Azure Portal.
Be careful with priority when editing this, as deployment will fail if there are conflicting priorities.
[Please refer to Microosft docs for more information on rule-processing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/rule-processing)

# Assumptions
 - All firewall policies configured exist in the same resource group.
 - To enable two way sync the AzOps Pull pipeline must be run before a push, otherwise it will overwrite changes made in the portal that has not been pulled in.
 - The delimiter should to be ',' This is configurable in the script by parameters (-Delimiter). space (' ') and semicolon (';') is reserved and should not be used.

# TODO
- Update so that the script can write to fwPolicy files. Currently it cannot associate child fw policies or rulecollectiongroups
- Create fwPolicies by defining them here
- ~~pipeline integration~~
- videos going step-by-step on how to implement and use
- ~~publish the script as a module in powershell gallery~~
- add whatif output
- ~~add functionality to print rules to console (whatif, writeToArm)~~
  - validate should only write result and not deploy
- ~~add functionality to remove configuration, currently the pipelines are only capable of adding~~
