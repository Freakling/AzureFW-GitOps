# AzureFW-HybridOps

This project intends to simplify and improve the user experience of authoring/configuring Azure Firewall Policies and rules.
It provides a two-way sync of rules and configuration allowing hybrid IaC & ClickOps Azure FW policy authoring.

In short the intention is to invent a new "way of working" with Azure Firewalls which I hope is more plesant than the current OOBE.

## How it works

This project utilizes [AzOps](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps) as the IaC backend and aims to mirror the structure that AzOps creates and uses.

At the heart of this project is a powershell scripts which translates between ``Azure ARM templates`` and ``HybridOps FW IaC``

- [Convert-ArmHybridOps.ps1](.scripts/Convert-ArmHybridOps.ps1)

To properly use this script it is recommended to integrate it into your ci/cd pipelines. There are some examples in this repository, but feel free to change and integrate and submit a PR to this repo with more examples

- [Azure DevOps Pipelines](.devops)
- [Github Actions](.github/workflows)

### Azure ARM templates -> HybridOps FW IaC

# Setup/More information
## AzOps file structure
```
ðŸ“‚<resourceGroupFolder>
 â”£ ðŸ“œmicrosoft.network_firewallpolicies-<policyName>.json
 â”£ ðŸ“œmicrosoft.network_firewallpolicies_rulecollectiongroups-<policyName>_<ruleCollGroupName>.json
 â”£ ...
 â”— ...
```

## Firewall HybridOps file structure
```
ðŸ“¦policies
 â”£ ðŸ“‚<policyName>
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚<ruleCollGroupName>
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚<ruleCollName>
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œApplicationRule.csv
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚<ruleCollName>
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œNetworkRule.csv
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚<ruleCollName>
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œNatRule.csv
 â”£ ðŸ“‚<policyName>
 â”ƒ â”—...
 â”— ðŸ“œpolicySettings.json
```
## Rule files and configuration
Headers follow ``FirewallPolicyRule`` objects, [more info in the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.network/firewallpolicies/rulecollectiongroups?pivots=deployment-language-arm-template#firewallpolicyrule-objects-1).
 At the time of writing AzOps performs a pull using apiVersion "2020-11-01". If the apiVersion adds a type it will automatically get included, albeit unsorted.

### ``ApplicationRule.csv``
```
name,ruleType,destinationAddresses,fqdnTags,protocols,sourceAddresses,sourceIpGroups,targetFqdns,targetUrls,terminateTLS,webCategories
```
#### Example
### ``NetworkRule.csv``
```
name,ruleType,destinationAddresses,destinationFqdns,destinationIpGroups,destinationPorts,ipProtocols,sourceAddresses,sourceIpGroups
```
#### Example
### ``NatRule.csv``
```
name,ruleType,destinationAddresses,destinationPorts,ipProtocols,sourceAddresses,sourceIpGroups,translatedAddress,translatedFqdn,translatedPort
```
#### Example
### ``policySettings.json``
``policySettings.json`` provides the more static configuration where Policy configuration can be stored, example of configuration defined here is child-policies, RuleCollectionGroup priority settings etc.
It is recommended to generate this file using the ``ConvertFrom-ArmFw`` function once the initial structure is created in Azure Portal.
Be careful with priority when editing this, as deployment will fail if there are conflicting priorities.

        },

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
]

# Assumptions
 - All firewall policies configured exist in the same resource group.
 - To enable two way sync the AzOps Pull pipeline must be run before a push, otherwise it will overwrite changes made in the portal that has not been pulled in.
 - The delimiter should to be ',' This is configurable in the script by setting the var $delimiter in the begin block. space (' ') and semicolon (';') is reserved

# Features to add
Create fwPolicies by defining them here
